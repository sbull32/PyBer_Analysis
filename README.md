# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine how our ride sharing program is working based on what type of city the program is being used in. We will analyze our current data to better understand what differences exist for both riders and drivers based on where they are located. By summarizing the differences between city types we hope to provide analysis that can be used to maximize our business.
