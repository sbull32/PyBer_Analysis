# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine how our ride sharing program is working based on what type of city the program is being used in. We will analyze our current data to better understand what differences exist for both riders and drivers based on where they are located. By summarizing the differences between city types we hope to provide analysis that can be used to maximize our business.

## Results
After our analysis we were able to determine differences between the 3 types of cities PyBer operates in including number of rides, drivers, total fares, and average fares per driver/rider. Total rides, drivers, and fares were highest in the urban cities while the lowest rides, drivers and fares were located in rural cities. However the average fare per ride and per driver was highest in the rural cities and lowest in urban areas. The suburban city data was in between the rural and urban city types in all categories.

Included in our analysis is a summary of the total weekly fares by city type for the months of January through April 2019

## Summary
Based on our analysis, I am recommending we do 3 things in order to address the disparities we are seeing among the city types. 
1. I would recommend increased market share in rural communities in order to make more money from our most profitable type of ride while also decreasing the average fare per rides for rural customers.
2. In addition, I am recommending we reduce our driver total in urban city types in order to increase the average fares our drivers make while not reducing our ride total or fares per ride.
3. Finally, I am recommending in increase in drivers during late february and early march in order to meet the rising demand we saw in 2019 during these months. If implemented correctly we could increase total fares while reducing the relatively high average costs per ride during those weeks.
